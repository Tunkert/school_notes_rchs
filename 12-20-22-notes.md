## Warmup

Today we began with a warmup on four different sat style questions - they were the following:

### Example 1 - SAT Style Question

The equation of a line is y = <sup>11</sup>/<sub>9</sub>x + <sup>3</sup>/<sub>2</sub>. Write an equation of a line that is *parallel* to this given line.

The key here is to realize that parallel lines have the same *slope* (the number in front of x). We'll keep the slope (number in front of x) but since we want a different line we'll need to change the y-intercept to <span style="text-decoration: uppercase;">any number except for <sup>3</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span>

Here are some example of what will work:

- y = <sup>11</sup>/<sub>9</sub>x
- y = <sup>11</sup>/<sub>9</sub>x + 7
- y = <sup>11</sup>/<sub>9</sub>x - 6

---

### Example 2 - SAT Style Question

The width of a rectangular pool that Jimmy McJimmy swims in is w yards. The length is 27 yards greater than the width. What is the perimeter of the pool in terms of w yards?

For this problem it helps to draw out a potential solution:

![a rectangle with width and length (in terms of width) drawn](https://images/img-12-20-22/rectangle-1.jpg)

From here we can add up the sides to find the perimeter (the total distance around the object). Adding up the sides we get <b>54 + 4w</b>, which is our solution.

---

### Example 3 - SAT Style Question

Consider the lines and triangle graphed below:

![a triange with two transversals](https://timunkert.win/tim/img/transversal-lines-3.PNG)

Lines l and m are parallel. Angle x is 72&deg; and angle y is 48&deg;. What is the measure of angle z?

In this particular problem it helps to break down each angle as shown in the drawing below.

---

### Example 4 - SAT Style Question

Consider the triangles below:

![two triangles overlapping](https://timunkert.win/tim/img/triangles-3.PNG)

NO and OQ are the same length. Let's say that we changed angle 0 so that it was 130&deg;. What is the measure of x in degrees?

Again we can break down this and solve for each of the smaller triangles:

## Algebra 1 - Need to Know for the final:

- Solving a System of Equations by Graphing
- Solving a System of Equations by Elimination
- Solving a System of Equations by Substituion
- Picking the best method (of the three above) to solve a system of equations

Let's go through some examples:

---

### Example 5 - Solving a System of Equations by Graphing (Algebra I)

Solve the following system of equations by graphing:

- y = 2x + 2
- y = 3x + 1

We can solve this equation by graphing our two equations and seeing where they intersect.

![two lines graphed on a coordinate plane intersecting at (1, 4)](htttps://upslopemath.com/images/img-12-20-22/systems-of-equations-graphing.jpg)

We can see they intersect at the point **(1, 4)** so this is our solution.

---

### Example 6 - Solving a System of Equations by Elimination (Algebra I)

Use elimination to solve the following system of equations:

- 5x + 2y = 16
- 3x - 2y = 0

In this case since we have a positive 2y in the top equation and a negative 2y in the bottom equation we can add both equations together to *eliminate* the y's. If we add both equations together we get:

- 8x = 16

We can then solve for x:

- 8x &divide; 8 = 16 &divide; 8
- **x = 2**

We can then use our value of x and substitute that into either the first equation or the second (it doesn't matter) to solve for y. Let's use the first:

- 5(2) + 2y = 16
- 10 + 2y = 16
- 10 - 10 + 2y = 16 - 10
- 2y = 6
- 2y &divide; 2 = 6 &divide; 2
- **y = 3**

Write our solution as a coordinate pair, our solution is **(2, 3)**.

---

### Example 7 - Solving a System of Equations by Substitution (Algebra I)

Solve the following system of equations by substitution:

- 7x - 4y = -27
- y = 4x + 9

Since the value of y is **4x + 9**, we can substitute that in for y in the top equation and solve for x:

- 7x - 4(4x + 9) = -27
- 7x - 16x - 36 = -27
- &minus;9x - 36 = -27
- &minus;9x - 36 + 36 = -27 + 36
- &minus;9x = 9
- &minus;9x &divide; &minus;9 = 9 &divide; &minus;9
- x = &minus;1

Now that we know the value of x we can substitute that value back into the second equation and solve for y:

- y = 4(&minus;1) + 9
- y = &minus;4 + 9
- y = 5

We can now write our solution as a coordinate pair: **(&minus;1, 5)**

---

### Example 8 - Choosing the Best Method to Solve a System of Equations (Algebra I)

To solve a system of equations you have three options, graphing, elimination, and substitution. On the final, you'll need to select the best method to solve a system of equations. Here are some guidelines:

- If both equations are of the form ax + by = c, where a, b, and c are numbers, then use elimination.
- If one equation is of the form y = mx + b and the other is of the form ax + cy = d, where a, b, c, and d are numbers use substitution
- If both equations are of the form y = mx + b, use graphing.

Which method would you use to solve the following system of equations:

- 4x + 6y = 10
- 9x - 6y = 3

**Answer**: this system of equations is best solved using **elimination** because you can eliminate y if you add the two equations together.

Which method would you use to solve the following system of equations:

- 5x + 5y = 10
- y = 3x - 6

**Answer**: this system of equations is best solved using **substitution** because you can substitute the value of y, 3x - 6, into the first equation to solve for x.

Which method would you use to solve the following system of equations:

- y = 3x - 5
- y = x + 1

**Answer**: this system of equations is best solved using **graphing** because both equations are in the form, y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept.

## Algebra 2 Examples

In Algebra 2 you'll need to be able to solve the following types of problems:

- Be able to graph linear and quadratic equations
- Be able to find the inverse of linear and quadratic functions, remember the steps:
	1. Replace f(x) with y.
	2. Switch x and y.
	3. Solve for y.
	4. Replace y with the inverse function notation, f<sup>&minus;1</sup>(x).
- Be able to factor quadratic equations when a = 1 and when a &ne; 1. Use the factored form to find solutions to the quadratic.
- Be able to use the Quadratic Formula to find the solutions to quadratics that are not factorable.

### Example 9 - Graph a Linear Function (Algebra 2)

Graph y = 4x - 1

In this particular case we'll start with start with &minus;1, the *y-intercept*. We can place this on the y-axis at the point (0, -1). From here we'll use the slope, 4, to move one unit right and move 4 units up. Here we will place another point at the point (1, 3). We can connect these points to form a line, see below:

![the line y = 4x - 1](/path-to-image/)

---

### Example 10 - Graph a Quadratic Function (Algebra 2)

Graph y = 2x<sup>2</sup> - 3

In this case we should make an x,y table:

| x | y = 2x<sup>2</sup> - 3 |
| - | ---------------------- |
| -2 | 2(-2)<sup>2</sup> - 3 = 5 |
| -1 | 2(-1)<sup>2</sup> - 3 = -1 |
| 0 | 2(0)<sup>2</sup> - 3 = -3 |
| 1 | 2(1)<sup>2</sup> - 3 = -1 |
| 2 | 2(2)<sup>2</sup> - 3 = 5 |

We can then plot these points on the coordinate plane, see below:

![The graph of y = 2x<sup>2</sup> - 3](/path-to-image)

---

### Example 11 - Find the Inverse of a Linear Function (Algebra 2)

Find the inverse of the linear function, f(x) = 3x + 4

1. Replace f(x) with y: y = 3x + 4
2. Switch x and y: x = 3y + 4
3. Solve for y:
	- x = 3y + 4
	- x - 4 = 3y + 4 - 4
	- x - 4 = 3y
	- (x - 4) &divide; 3 = 3y &divide; 3
	- (x - 4) &divide; 3 = y
4. Replace y with f<sup>&minus;1</sup>(x): f<sup>&minus;1</sup>(x) = (x - 4) / 3

---

### Example 12 - Find the Inverse of a Quadratic Function (Algebra 2)

Find the inverse of the quadratic function, f(x) = 2x<sup>2</sup> - 3.

1. Replace f(x) with y: y = 2x<sup>2</sup> - 3
2. Switch x and y: x = 2y<sup>2</sup> - 3
3. Solve for y:
	- x = 2y<sup>2</sup> - 3
	- x + 3 = 2y<sup>2</sup> - 3 + 3
	- (x + 3) &divide; 2 = 2y<sup>2</sup> &divide; 2
	- (x + 3) / 2 = y<sup>2</sup>
	- &radic;<span style="text-decoration: overline;">(x + 3) / 2</span> = y
4. Replace y with f<sup>&minus;1</sup>(x): f<sup>&minus;1</sup>(x) = &radic;<span style="text-decoration: overline;">(x + 3) / 2</span>

### Example 13 - Factor a Quadratic where a = 1 (Algebra 2)

Factor the following quadratic:

x<sup>2</sup> - 9x + 20

Then find the solutions to the quadratic.

We'll first start by listing the factors of 20, which are:

- 1 and 20
- &minus;1 and &minus;20
- 2 and 10
- &minus;2 and &minus;10
- 4 and 5
- &minus;4 and &minus;5

We then need to find the factors of 20 that add to &minus;9, they are

- &minus;4 and &minus;5

We can now write our quadratic in factored form:

- (x - 4)(x - 5)

We can then solve the quadratic by setting each of the binomial factors equal to zero:

- x - 4 = 0
- x - 4 + 4 = 0 + 4
- **x = 4**

- x - 5 = 0
- x - 5 + 5 = 0 + 5
- **x = 5**

So the solutions to this quadratic are **x = 4 and x = 5**.

---

### Example 14 - Factor a Quadratic Where a &ne; 1 (Algebra 2)

Factor and solve the following quadratic:

- 12x<sup>2</sup> - 5x - 2

To solve this quadratic we'll need to list the factors of -2 and 12, first we'll start with the factors of -2:

- &minus;1 and 2
- 1 and &minus;2

Then we'll list the factors of 12:

- 1 and 12
- 2 and 6
- 3 and 4

When listing the factors in front of x<sup>2</sup>, it's best to stick with the positive factors (when you multiply by the negative factors of c it'll work out anyways).

Now we must combine the sum of the product of the factor pairs so that they add to &minus;5.

- 3 &times; 1 + 4 &times; &minus;2 = &minus;5

We can then write this in factored form as:

- (3x - 2)(4x + 1)

Just make sure that you check this with FOIL to make sure you placed the coefficients and constants in the correct order.

---

### Example 15 - Find the Solutions to a Quadratic using the Quadratic Formula (Algebra 2)

Find the solutions to the following quadratic:

- x<sup>2</sup> + 6x = 10

First we need to make sure the quadratic is equal to zero, so we'll subtract 10 from both sides:

- x<sup>2</sup> + 6x - 10 = 10 - 10
- x<sup>2</sup> + 6x - 10 = 0

We'll now identify a, b, and c:

- a = 1
- b = 6
- c = -10

We can now plug these into the quadratic formula and work out our solution:

### Example 16 - Find the Solutions to a Quadratic using the Quadratic Formula (Algebra 2)

Find the solutinos to the following quadratic:

- x<sup>2</sup> - 7x + 11 = 0

Since this quadratic is already equal to zero, we can go ahead and solve.
